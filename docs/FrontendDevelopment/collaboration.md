Here’s who they work with:

---

## Designers 
- **Who they are**: People who make websites look awesome (colors, buttons, fonts).  
- **How we work together**:  
  - Turn their designs into real websites.  
  - Ask questions if something is unclear.  
  - Suggest ideas to make websites easier to use.

- **How we work together**:  
  - Connect the website to data (like showing products).  
  - Agree on how frontend and backend talk to each other.  
  - Report issues if something breaks.
