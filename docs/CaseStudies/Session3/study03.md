# Chat Control

## Scenario

PrivateChat is a privacy-focused messaging app with **50 million global users** and complete end-to-end encryption. Unlike other messaging apps, PrivateChat doesn't collect user data or show ads. Instead, they survive from voluntary donations from users.

The company has built its entire reputation on protecting journalists, activists, abuse survivors, and ordinary people. However, the app is also quite popular among people who engage in illegal activity, such as drug dealing.

Now the EU demands implementation of "Chat Control" - automated message scanning system that would break encryption to detect illegal content (and arguably protect children). This would require PrivateChat to create backdoors in their encryption system, breaking the privacy protection that made their app popular.

**The founders are facing an impossible choice:** 
- Their legal advisors advocate for implementing the scanning technology and breaking encryption, betraying their core mission and the trust of 50 million users  
- The engineering team refuses to comply. That would force the company to shut down or block all European users, losing 30 million users and most of their donation income  
- Their business advisors say itâ€™s time to pivot or sell the company  
- Their friend Pavel Durov recommends relocating the entire company outside the EU but warns about the legal challenges  

The founders know that whatever they decide will affect not just their business, but the privacy and safety of millions of people who depend on secure communication.

## Financial Reality

- 40% of users (28M) are in EU  
- Operating costs of $18-25M annually  
- Dependent on major donor funding (like Signal's $105M from Brian Acton)

## Discussion Questions

- If you were the founders, how would you proceed and why?  
- If you chose to **comply** with Chat Control, how would you differentiate from WhatsApp and Telegram going forward? What's your new value proposition when privacy is compromised?  
- If you choose to **resist or pivot**, identify ONE specific geographic market and ONE adjacent business opportunity to replace that lost revenue  
- If you chose to **relocate or have a novel strategy**, what are the 3 most critical actions you must take in the next 30 days to execute it?  
- How would your decision be different if the company held investment from venture capital?  
- What is the safest way to technically implement ChatControl in a messaging software? What are the biggest security risks? Research in groups
