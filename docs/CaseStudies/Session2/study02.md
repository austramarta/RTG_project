# My_Printf  

## Scenario  

Seven weeks into the StartSchool program, students are assigned to recreate the `printf` function in C. This is a challenging project designed to test their understanding of variadic functions, string formatting, and low-level programming concepts.  

- **Jamie** is struggling after several days of work. They decide to use ChatGPT for help, starting with questions about variadic functions and format specifiers. As the deadline approaches, Jamie starts coding using GitHub Copilot, accepting the automatic AI code suggestions and asking it to generate code segments.  

- **Alex** starts by feeding the assignment description to Claude and asking it to paraphrase the task in simpler terms to help them understand what's required. They then Google the official documentation for each function mentioned in the task (like `va_start`, `va_arg`, etc.) and read through. It doesn't make sense to them, so they ask Claude to paraphrase it. As they write their own code, Alex periodically asks Claude to review their logic and provide feedback on their approach, but explicitly asks the AI agent to only point out potential issues in their thinking.  

- **Sam** takes a different approach and finds a comprehensive YouTube tutorial titled *"Building Printf from Scratch."* They follow along step-by-step, pausing to understand each concept, make notes, and type out the code themselves.  

- **Taylor** decides to Google *"printf implementation in C"* and finds several complete projects on GitHub. They study multiple versions and then write their own based on that.  

All students submit working `printf` implementations.

## Discussion Questions  

1. How does each of these approaches relate to StartSchool's code of conduct, and why?  
2. How do these different approaches compare in terms of learning value?  
3. Where do you draw the line between acceptable research/learning and academic dishonesty?
