# Debrief 2: My_Printf  

## Scenario  

During code review, the automatic check system marks **Jamie’s** code as plagiarised.  
When asked why they chose their approach, Jamie cannot answer — they never studied different approaches. Instead, they asked AI to solve the problem and accepted its automatic suggestions.  
This clearly breaks the code of conduct, so Jamie faces a *do-or-die* coding challenge for the project.  

Jamie memorises their code and successfully rewrites it on paper during the challenge. However, they fail to answer theoretical questions about their solution. Unfortunately, that marks the end of Jamie’s studies at StartSchool.  

**Alex’s** approach of using AI for clarification and feedback while writing original code passes the automated checks easily. During the code review discussion, Alex articulates their process clearly and demonstrates deep understanding of the underlying concepts.  
This represents the *ideal* use of external resources — as learning aids rather than solution providers.  
The only problem with Alex’s code is that it has a single “God” function that is 70 lines long. Reviewers advise Alex to reference other implementations and learn more about modular code design.  

**Sam’s** implementation follows a popular tutorial methodology, so it also gets flagged as plagiarism. They face a *do-or-die* coding challenge, where they replicate the code and explain its logic. However, they cannot propose an alternative approach since they relied entirely on the tutorial.  
They keep their place in StartSchool but realise that following tutorials will not make them a valuable team member in the workplace. For later projects, they change their approach and begin generating ideas first before consulting Stack Overflow or documentation.  

**Taylor’s** project is inspired by several GitHub projects. They demonstrate that they read the official documentation for variadic functions, understood each piece of referenced code, and used AI as a discussion partner to test their reasoning.  
Taylor can explain their choices and modify their code when asked. The decision is borderline — if they had simply copied and pasted without the additional research and understanding, they would have faced the same consequences as Jamie.

## Conclusion  

We encourage students to seek information from different sources, **BUT** always think for yourself first before consulting external material.  

- Search for **specific concepts** (e.g., *string formatting*) rather than the entire task (e.g., *printf*).  
- Stack Overflow is often more useful than both AI
