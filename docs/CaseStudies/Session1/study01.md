# The Helpful Feedback

## Scenario
During a coding review session at StartSchool, Maya, a 61-year-old career changer from marketing, is presenting her mobile app prototype to a small group. The app is designed to help elderly users manage their medications.

Alex, a 21-year-old recent computer science graduate, listens to Maya's presentation and then says:  
*"It's actually impressive that you managed to build something that works. Maybe you should focus on simpler features though, you know, since your target users are old people anyway."*

Later, during a break, Alex approaches Maya and says:  
*"Hey, I noticed you're struggling with JavaScript. That's totally normal for you to find the logic parts hard. I'd be happy to help you with the technical stuff, so you can focus on the design."*

Several other students overhear these interactions. Maya appears uncomfortable but doesn't say anything directly to Alex.
