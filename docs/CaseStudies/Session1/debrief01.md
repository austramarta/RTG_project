# Debrief 1: Understanding Micro-Aggressions  

Micro-aggressions are small actions or comments that reveal negative bias based on age, gender, race, experience, or other characteristics.  
While often unintentional, they can undermine confidence and create a hostile environment.  

In Maya’s case, Alex’s comments contain several micro-aggressions. Think about it:  

- Why is it considered “impressive” that Maya built something after studying it, just like everyone else?  
  Because Alex assumed Maya would find it difficult (due to her age, gender, or another biased assumption).  
- What’s the intention behind such comments? What’s the effect?  
- Would you like to work with someone who offers help only because they assume you can’t do something based on how you look?  
  (If your answer is “yes,” perhaps you should reconsider whether you actually enjoy the work or simply want to delegate it.)

## What to Do  

### Bystanders  
- Speak up publicly and check in with Maya privately.  
- Explain the impact of such words to Alex in a calm manner. Everyone holds stereotypes, but they can be challenged.  
- Document the situation (date, what was said, who was present) and share with the organizers.  
- Avoid micro-aggressions in your own interactions, and don’t make excuses for Alex.  

### Alex (Person Commenting)  
- Listen, don’t defend yourself. Does it matter if *“you didn’t mean it that way”* if someone else’s day just became worse?  
- Focus on the **effect**, not the intent.  
- Apologize genuinely.  
- Challenge your own biases and work on your insecurities.  

### Maya (Person Receiving Harmful Comments)  
- Remember: such situations reflect the commenter’s issues, not your abilities.  
- Document what was said and who was present, and share with the organizers.  
- Speak directly with Alex if you feel comfortable doing so.

## Guiding Principle  

**Always think:**  
*Is it True? Is it Necessary? Is it Kind?*
