# The Interview Assistant

## Scenario

Roy, a 21-year-old computer science student, approaches you with an exciting business idea. They've built an AI-powered application that can help people during technical interviews.

> "Look," Roy says, "the interview process is completely broken. Companies make people spend months studying coding problems that have nothing to do with the actual job. My app can level the playing field."

Roy explains the concept: The app takes screenshots during technical interviews, analyzes coding problems in real-time, and provides smart guidance to help candidates answer questions. It's completely undetectable — it works as an invisible overlay and even moves around the screen so your eyes look natural.

> "I've tested it myself and got job offers from major tech companies. Now I want to scale this up and help thousands of people get jobs they deserve."

Roy offers you a founding team position with equity in the company. They plan to:  

- Launch with a viral marketing campaign  
- Record real interviews (without telling the companies) to show how well it works  
- Price it at **$299 per month** — targeting the desperation of job seekers  
- Market it as "interview preparation" rather than cheating  

> "The best part," Alex continues, "is that we're exposing how meaningless these interviews really are. If AI can pass them, what does that say about the process?"
