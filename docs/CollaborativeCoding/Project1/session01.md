# Session 1 | HTML & Structure (2 hours)

### Title
**The Skeleton**

### What to Build
A homepage with each team member's:

- Name
- Photo or avatar
- Short bio
- 1–3 fun fact sections
- Contact section with email/socials

### Skills Covered
- `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- Headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists
- Semantic structure (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)

### Outcome
Students have a working single-page website with real content, but no styling or JavaScript yet.

### 2-Minute Presentation Requirements  

#### Show Your Page 
- Open it in the browser.  
- Point out one section you’re proud of (e.g., bio, fun facts, or contact section).  

#### Explain Your HTML 
- Show the structure of your file (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).  
- Mention one semantic tag you used (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) and why.  
- Highlight one piece of content you added (image, list, or link).  

#### Reflect 
- Briefly say what was easy vs. what was challenging.  
- Share one thing you’d like to add or improve if you had more time.
