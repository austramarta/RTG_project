# Session 3 | JavaScript Interactivity (2 hours)

### Title
**Let’s Make It Alive!**

### What to Add
- A “Surprise Me” button that shows a random fact  
- Toggle dark/light mode  
- Alert or popup welcome message  

### Skills Covered
- DOM selection (`document.querySelector`)  
- Event listeners (`click`)  
- Class toggling  
- `Math.random()` and arrays  

### Outcome
Students now have a complete, styled, interactive personal site — a great first portfolio piece.

### Optional Stretch (for early finishers)
- Add a collapsible section (accordion)  
- Allow the user to submit a new fun fact (not saved)

### 2-min presentation requirements

#### Show Your Page (30 sec)  
- Open it in the browser.  
- Demonstrate one interactive feature you added (e.g., “Surprise Me” button, dark/light mode, or popup message).  

#### Explain Your JavaScript (1 min)  
- Show where your JavaScript is written (separate file or inline script).  
- Mention one DOM method you used (e.g., `document.querySelector`) and why.  
- Highlight one concept you applied:  
  - Event listener (`click`)  
  - Class toggling  
  - `Math.random()` with arrays  

#### Reflect (30 sec)  
- Briefly say what was easy vs. what was challenging.  
- Share one improvement or stretch feature you’d add if you had more time.
