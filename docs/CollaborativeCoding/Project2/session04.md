# Session 4 | HTML Skeleton (2 hours)

## Title: The Quiz Frame

### What to Build
Teams create the basic structure of a quiz app:

- Page title & header: **“Quiz Me If You Can”**
- Section for questions and multiple-choice answers
- A button to submit the quiz
- A results area (blank for now)

### Skills Covered
- HTML [forms](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp)
- Grouping questions with [form elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp)

### Outcome
By the end of Session 4, each team has a functioning HTML skeleton with **3–5 questions**, answer choices, and a “Submit” button — but no scoring logic yet.

### 2-Minute Presentation Requirements
- Open the page in the browser and show the quiz form.
- Explain how one question is structured (e.g.radio buttons).
- Highlight something that has been personalized (e.g., funny answer choices).
- Share what was easy and what was confusing.
