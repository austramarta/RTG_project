# Quiz Me If You Can

## Project Goal
Build a fun multiple-choice quiz game in permanent teams that lets users answer 3–5 questions and discover their “vegetable personality.”

- **Basic layout and questions (HTML)**  
  Create the quiz structure with questions, answer choices, and a submit button.  
  - Use **HTML forms** to group questions and capture answers.  
  - Use `<form>` to wrap the quiz.  
  - Use html form elements to organize each question.  
  - Plan where the results will appear.  

- **Styling and structure (CSS)**  
  Make the quiz look like a real game with clear sections, styled buttons, and fun design elements.  

- **Interactivity and logic (JavaScript)**  
  Add functionality so that when the quiz is submitted, answers are checked, resultss are calculated, and a playful result (e.g., “You’re a Carrot!”) is displayed.  

Each session builds on the last and introduces one new major concept.
