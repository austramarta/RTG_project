# Session 5 | JavaScript & Game Logic (2 hours)

## Title: The Quiz Brain

### What to Build
Teams bring their quiz to life with JavaScript logic:

- Store correct answers in an array/object.  
- Add event handling: when the user clicks **“Submit”**, JS checks the answers.  
- Use **if/else** or **switch** statements to calculate a score or personality outcome.  
- Display results in the **results area**.  

Example:  
*“You’re a Carrot: bright, crunchy, and full of energy!”*

---

### Skills Covered
- Arrays/objects for storing quiz questions/answers  
- Event listeners (`addEventListener`) for the button  
- If/else or switch statements for logic  
- DOM manipulation (`document.querySelector`, `.innerText`)  

---

### Outcome
By the end of Session 5, each team has a **fully working multiple-choice quiz game** that gives feedback and a playful *“vegetable personality”* result.

### 2-Minute Presentation Requirements
- **Play through their quiz live.**  
- **Show the result screen.**  
- Point out **one piece of JavaScript logic** they’re proud of.  
- Explain **what was hardest to figure out.**  
- Suggest **how they’d improve the quiz** with more time (e.g., add images, randomize questions, track score).
