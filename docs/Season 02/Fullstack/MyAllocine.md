## üí° Advice for completing the task
- last query in the requirements is wrong. To successfully pass test, you need to change the array key to what Gandalf expects there
  - In project requirements it is:
    ```bash 
    requests["Find all the actors who have not acted in any movie released between 1990 and 2000 (select only actor first name, last name, movie title and release year) sorted by actor ID)"]
    ```
  - But Gandalf expects this array key (note the ending part):
    ```bash
    requests["Find all the actors who have not acted in any movie between 1990 and 2000 (select only actor first name, last name, movie title and release year)"]
    ```
