## Discord Connection: How to Find Help

Discord serves as a central communication hub for collaboration and problem-solving. To find help, start by joining your designated server and locating the appropriate channel for your query (e.g., #tech-support or #general-questions). Be specific and concise when asking questions to ensure others can provide accurate assistance. Additionally, explore pinned messages and search the channel history for similar issues and solutions.

## Use Gandalfs: Automated Test Runner

Gandalfs is an automated testing tool that ensures your code meets the required standards and functionality. When you submit your work, Gandalf runs tests to verify your implementation. This helps catch errors early and teaches you to write code that adheres to the defined specifications. Always check your test results and resolve any failing cases before moving forward.

## First Git Add and Push: Introduction to Git

### What is Git?

Git is a version control system that tracks changes in your code over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently while maintaining a history of modifications.

### Why Do We Need Git?

- **Collaboration**: Share your work with teammates and combine efforts seamlessly.
- **Versioning**: Maintain a history of your project and revert to earlier states if needed.
- **Backup**: Keep your code safe by syncing it with remote repositories like GitHub.

### How to Git Add and Push

1. **Stage Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   This stages all your modified files for the next commit.

2. **Commit Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```
   This saves a snapshot of your current changes.

3. **Push to Remote Repository**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   This uploads your changes to the remote repository.

## First Standup Report

### What is a Standup?

A standup is a daily meeting where team members share updates on their progress. It typically covers three main points:
- **What you did yesterday**
- **What you plan to do today**
- **Any blockers you're facing**

### How to Create Your Report

1. **Structure Your Update**:
   Example format:
   - *Yesterday*: Completed the user login feature.
   - *Today*: Start working on the database schema.
   - *Blockers*: Need clarification on the admin role permissions.

2. **Submit It**:
   Share your report on the designated platform or channel.

## Upload a Picture

To upload a picture in your workspace:
1. **Prepare Your Image**:
   Ensure the file size and format are appropriate.

2. **Use the Upload Option**:
   - On Discord: Drag and drop the file into the desired channel or click the "+" button to upload.
   - On other platforms: Locate the upload button and follow the instructions.

## Standup Report Setup: Configure Active Days

To set up your standup schedule:
1. Choose active days (e.g., Monday to Friday).
2. Use a project management tool to set reminders for submission.
3. Ensure all team members are aligned on the schedule and format.

## First Readme

### Importance of Readmes

A README file is the introductory document for your project. It explains:
- **What the project is**
- **How to set it up**
- **How to use it**

Include sections for contributors, license, and additional resources as needed.

## Create a Group

Groups form organically as the project progresses. Focus on collaboration, shared goals, and regular communication. Once the need arises, define roles and establish a group with clear objectives. Take your time and ensure every member is on the same page.
