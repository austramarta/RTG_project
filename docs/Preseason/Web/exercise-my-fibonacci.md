# My Fibonacci C

Welcome to the My Fibonacci exercise of Preseason Web track! Here you will get familiar with the concept of recursion in C.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Recursion Concept**: Learn what is recursion in C.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Learn how to generate Fibonacci numbers using recursion.

## üìù Task Requirements

- **Function prototype**: Follow the expected input type & output type for the program.
- **Function naming**: Name the program according to the task's requirements.
- **Gandalf Testing**: Your program must pass Gandalf test(-s).

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful resources for accomplishing this task

- **Platform for practicing C core concepts!**
- **Recursion in C**
- **Fibonacci Sequence**

## üí° Advice for completing the task

- Make sure to keep parameters' (param_1, param_2,...) names relevant to the function. It improves readability of the code both for you and for someone reviewing your code.
- Make sure to name the function according to its function. This is a general advice, in this exercise it's already done by Qwasar ;)
- Make sure to put a semicolon `;` after the function and after each statement inside.
