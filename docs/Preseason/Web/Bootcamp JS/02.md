# Js Quest02

Welcome to the Quest02 of JavaScript Bootcamp, Preseason Web track! Here you will get familiar with the syntax of `JavaScript` and practice adding logic to your code.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **JavaScript syntax**: Learn & practice JavaScript syntax.
- **Variables**: Practice assigning `integer`, `character` and `string` variables.
- **Loops**: Learn what a `loop` is and practice automation.
- **Conditional statements**: Practice writing conditional `if` and `if else` statements.
- **Comparison operators**: Get to know what comparison operators are and practice using them in your code.
- **Dynamic updating**: Learn how to dynamically change the contents of the page using JavaScript.

## üìù Task Requirements

1. **Directory Structure**: For each exercise, create a folder `ex0n` where `n` is a number of the exercise. See `submit directory`.
2. **Git**: Git add, git commit & git push each exercise.
3. **File Naming**: Use specific file names for each exercise provided under `submit file(s)`.
4. **Testing**: **NO** tests should be provided in source files.
5. **Gandalf Testing**: All exercises must pass Gandalf tests.

### Advice for completing the tasks
1. You can write comments inside your code using `//`. They are **ignored by the computer**.
2. Make sure to put a semicolon `;` after each JavaScript statement.
3. Make sure to save `Ctrl + S` the changes you do to the code.
4. [Use Google to your advantage!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-google-like-a-pro-10-tips-for-effective-googling/)
