## üí° Advice for completing the task

1. Make sure ko keep parameters' `param_1`, `param_2` names relevant to the function. It **improves readability of the code** both for you and for someone reviewing your code.
2. Make sure to name *the* function accordingly to it's function. This is a general advice, in this exercise it's **already done** by Qwasar ;)
3. Make sure to put a semicolon `;` after the function and after each statement inside.
