# My CSS Is Easy I

Welcome to the **My CSS is Easy I**, where you'll learn to create a flexible and stylish web page using Flexbox. Below are the key requirements and instructions to complete this task.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Flexbox Layout**: The page must exclusively use Flexbox for layout alignment. Using float will result in failure.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - **Mobile View**: Activated when screen width is less than 640px.
  - **Desktop View**: Activated when screen width is 640px or more.
- **Named Sections**: Each section displays its name (e.g., "HEADER," "HERO").
- **Color Themes**:
  - **Header**: `#00B7EB`
  - **Hero**: `#FF0000`
  - **Content**: `#00FF00`
  - **Sidebar**: `#800080`
  - **Footer**: `#444444`

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Program Works

- **HTML File**: Name the file `index.html`.
- **CSS File**: Name the file `style.css`.
- **Flexbox**: Ensure all alignment and layout adjustments are done using Flexbox.
- **Section Names**: Use `div` tags for layout with clear names (e.g., `div id="header"`).
- **Responsive Media Query**: Use CSS media queries to switch between mobile and desktop views.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

- **Improper Layout**: Any use of float instead of Flexbox will be marked as incorrect.
- **Unclear Section Names**: Ensure each `div` is named appropriately for clarity.
- **Missing Files**: Ensure both `index.html` and `style.css` are included.
