# My Recursive Pow C

Welcome to the My Recursive Pow exercise of Preseason Web track! Here you will learn how to calculate the power of a number using recursion in C.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Recursion**: Learn how to use recursion to solve problems.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Understand how to perform power calculations.

## üìù Task Requirements

- **Function prototype**: Follow the expected input type & output type for the program.
- **Function naming**: Name the program according to the task's requirements.
- **Gandalf Testing**: Your program must pass Gandalf test(-s).

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful resources for accomplishing this task

- **Platform for practicing C core concepts!**
- **Recursion in C**
- **Mathematical Operations in C**

## üí° Advice for completing the task

- Make sure to keep parameters' (param_1, param_2,...) names relevant to the function. It improves readability of the code both for you and for someone reviewing your code.
- Make sure to name the function according to its function. This is a general advice, in this exercise it's already done by Qwasar ;)
- Make sure to put a semicolon `;` after the function and after each statement inside.
