# My_add `JavaScript`

Welcome to the My_add exercise of Preseason Web track! Here you will learn more about how `math` in programming works & practice passing multiple parameters to the function.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Math & Arithmetic Operators**: Learn how to perform `addition` of two `values` in JavaScript.
- **Number concept**: Get familiar with the concept of a `number` in JavaScript.
- **Function syntax**: Get familiar with the syntax that JavaScript `functions` use.
- **Parameters**: Learn to assign multiple `parameters` to the function.

## üìù Task Requirements

1. **Function prototype**: Follow expected `input type` & `output type` for the program.
2. **Function naming**: Name the program accordingly to the task's requirements.
3. **Gandalf Testing**: Your program must pass Gandalf test(-s).

## üí° Advice for completing the task

1. Make sure ko keep parameters' `param_1`, `param_2` names relevant to the function. It **improves readability of the code** both for you and for someone reviewing your code.
2. Make sure to name *the* function accordingly to it's function. This is a general advice, in this exercise it's **already done** by Qwasar ;)
3. Make sure to put a semicolon `;` after the function and after each statement inside.
