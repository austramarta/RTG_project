## üí° Advice for completing the task

1. Make sure ko keep parameters' `param_1` names relevant to the function. It **improves readability of the code** both for you and for someone reviewing your code. For `Hello Name` exercise good options are `name` (person's name we're passing as an argument) or `string` (data type we are passing).
2. Make sure to name *the* function accordingly to it's function. This is a general advice, in this exercise it's already done by Qwasar ;)
3. Make sure to put a semicolon `;` after the function and after each statement inside.
