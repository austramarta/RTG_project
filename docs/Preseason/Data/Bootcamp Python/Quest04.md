# Python Quest04

In this quest, you will learn how to manipulate strings and work with loops and indexes in Python. You will implement functions to find character positions, change string cases, and calculate string lengths without using built-in functions like `upper()`, `lower()`, and `len()`.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Working with strings**: Manipulate strings and their characters, such as casing and calculating the length.
- **Working with loops and indexes**: Iterate over arrays and keep index counters.

## üìù Task Requirements

1. **Directory Structure**: Each exercise must be in its own directory (ex00, ex01, etc.)
2. **Git Usage**: Every exercise must be committed and pushed to Git
3. **File Naming**: Exact file names must be followed as specified in each exercise
4. **No Test Files**: Do not include any test files in your submissions
5. **Gandalf Testing**: All exercises must pass the gandalf test

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful resources for acomplishing this task

### Working with character casing
Each character has a Unicode value assigned to it behind the scenes, e.g., `A = 65`, `B = 66`. You can convert each character to a Unicode value, increase or decrease the value by the needed amount, and convert it back to a character.
