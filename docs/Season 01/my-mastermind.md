# My Mastermind

Welcome to the **My Mastermind Project**, where you will create a console-based version of the classic Mastermind game in C. This project will help you understand game logic, user input handling, and algorithm implementation.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Game Logic**: Implement the core Mastermind game mechanics.
- **User Interface**: Create an interactive console-based game.
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Develop efficient code-breaking strategies.
- **Input Validation**: Handle user input safely and effectively.

## 📝 Game Description

Mastermind is a code-breaking game where:
- The computer generates a secret code (usually 4 digits/colors)
- The player attempts to guess the code
- After each guess, the computer provides feedback:
  - Correct digits in correct positions
  - Correct digits in wrong positions
- The goal is to break the code in as few attempts as possible

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Code Generation**: Random or predetermined secret codes
- **Input Handling**: Accept and validate player guesses
- **Feedback System**: Provide accurate hints after each guess
- **Game Flow**: Manage game state and win/lose conditions
- **User Experience**: Clear instructions and game status display

## 🛠️ Implementation Tips

- Use appropriate data structures for storing codes and guesses
- Implement proper input validation to prevent crashes
- Consider the algorithm for providing feedback
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Make the game user-friendly with clear prompts

## 🎮 Example Game Flow

```
Welcome to Mastermind!
I'm thinking of a 4-digit code...
Enter your guess (4 digits): 1234
Feedback: 1 correct digit in correct position, 1 correct digit in wrong position
Enter your guess (4 digits): 1567
Feedback: 1 correct digit in correct position, 0 correct digits in wrong position
...
```

## 🤔 Final Notes

This project combines game design, algorithm implementation, and user experience. Focus on creating a robust and enjoyable game. Good luck!
