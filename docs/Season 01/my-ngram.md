# My Ngram

Welcome to the **My Ngram Project**, where you will create a tool for analyzing text using n-grams. This project will help you understand text processing and data analysis in C.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Text Analysis**: Process text files and extract n-gram patterns.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common sequences of characters or words.
- **Data Processing**: Handle large text files efficiently.

## üìù Project Description

The n-gram analysis tool processes text to find patterns of n consecutive characters or words. This is useful for:
- Language modeling
- Text prediction
- Pattern recognition
- Data mining

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Input**: Text files for analysis
- **Output**: N-gram frequency statistics
- **Performance**: Efficient processing of large files
- **Memory Management**: Careful handling of memory allocation

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Tips

- Use appropriate data structures for storing n-grams
- Consider memory efficiency when processing large files
- Implement proper error handling
- Test with various text sizes and formats

## ü§î Final Notes

This project will help you understand text processing algorithms and improve your C programming skills. Good luck!
